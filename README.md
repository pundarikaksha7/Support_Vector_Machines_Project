Welcome to my Support Vector Machine Project! We will be analyzing the famous iris data set!

# The Data

We will be using the famous Iris flower data set.
The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by Sir Ronald Fisher in the 1936 as an example of discriminant analysis.
The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor), so 150 total samples. Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters.

We will use the ```SVM``` model to predict the species of the Iris flowers based on properties such as length and width of the sepals and petals.
